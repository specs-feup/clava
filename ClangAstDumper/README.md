# Building

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

The CMakeLists.txt has two targets, `plugin` and `tool`, use `<MAKE_CMD> <target>` to build a specific target.

The target `tool` has been successfully built in Ubuntu and Windows (MinGW), make sure the executable clang-<VERSION> is in the path, as well as the path `/usr/lib/llvm-<VERSION>` (`C:/usr/...` in Windows).
