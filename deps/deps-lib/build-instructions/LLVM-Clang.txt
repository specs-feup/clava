CLANG
=======

Windows
-------

- Install MSYS2 (http://msys2.github.io/)
 -> Make sure it has gcc, cmake and ninja (pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-<toolname>)
- Build LLVM and Clang
 -> Go to the releases page (http://llvm.org/releases/download.html) and download the source code for LLVM, Clang and clang-tools-extra
 -> Extract LLVM sources to a folder, create folder tools/clang and extract Clang to there, create folder tools/clang/tools/extra and extract clang-tools-extra to there
 -> Before building, edit the file llvm/CMakeLists.txt and add after the version the following, to avoid errors such as "SemaExpr.cpp.obj: too many sections":
	SET(GCC_BIG_OBJ    "-Wa,-mbig-obj")
	add_definitions(${GCC_BIG_OBJ})
 -> Make sure you have Python installed natively in the Windows system, and that it is in the path. Python from MSYS/MinGW might give error paths during CMake. Additionally, if you use the Python installer to add it to the path, check if it does not put a '/' at the end of the path, or it will not work (e.g. export PATH=/c/Apps/Python3:/c/Apps/Python3/Scripts:$PATH)
 -> Create a folder for the build (e.g., llvm/../build) and run CMake for Ninja (e.g., cmake -G Ninja ../llvm -DLLVM_BUILD_TESTS=ON)
 cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" ../llvm -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_BUILD_TOOLS=OFF -DLLVM_INCLUDE_EXAMPLES=OFF -DLLVM_BUILD_TESTS=OFF -DLLVM_INCLUDE_TESTS=OFF -DLLVM_PARALLEL_COMPILE_JOBS=1 -DLLVM_ENABLE_EH=ON -DLLVM_ENABLE_RTTI=ON -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER:PATH="<path to clang.exe" -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER:PATH="path to clang++.exe" -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="X86" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=%devpath%\llvm
 -> Build (e.g., mingw32-make). Linking LLVM + Clang in DEBUG mode takes a lot of memory (+3GB). If your computer has a lot of cores for the memory and you are building in DEBUG, run ninja with flag -j N (e.g., 3) to limit the number of parallel runs
